# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

## No coding necessary
To complete this tutorial, you need a [GitHub.com account] and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).

     Tip: Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.
